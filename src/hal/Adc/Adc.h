     * ADC interface for determining supply voltage.

     * The supply voltage is determined based on the internal reference
     * voltage of ~ 1100mv. Note that the internal voltage varies slightly
     * between chips. The result is therefore not accurate, but good enough
     * for defining a cut-off voltage that avoids draining recharchable
     * battries to death.
     *
     * It is possible to calibrate the voltage based on knowledge of the 
     * exact internal voltage. For this, the supply voltage must be 
     * accurately known and set (see define SUPPLY_VOLTAGE). The channel
     * ADC_CHN_CALIBRATION_MV delivers the internal voltage in mV, given
     * a known supply voltage.
