# Software Architecture

This page defines the software architecture of the EPaperFrame.
## Software Context

The software is developed in C/C++ and runs on the AVR328P micro controller. The following picture shows the context of the software. The file system and display is controlled using a single SPI interface and two MOSFETs to disable their power in sleep.

The other interfaces are used for flashing (ISP) and debugging (LED, UART) purposes only.

## System State Maschine

The application is a small state machine which toggles betwen updating the display and sleeping to save power.

## Class Diagram

A typical embedded 3 Layer Architecture is used in this project. Dependencies only go down to lower layers.

### App Layer

This part implements the application logic and utilizes a service layer for interacting with the system.

### Service Layer

This part implements generic services on top of Hal.

### Hal Layer

This part implements the interface to the AVR 328P microcontroller.

## Architecture Rules

* System is static, there is no heap usage or dynamic object generation.
* Classes are implemented as singletons or have only static elements as the system is static.
* Favour many short over fewer large classes (small is beautiful).
* Distribute code phases to states even if they are small (extensibility).^
* Save power as mutch as possible by utilizing sleep modes and unbpwering 
  unsused devices.
